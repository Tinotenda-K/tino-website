                            Tino Karambakuwa is a Zimbabwean-born artist, programmer and developer who is currently based in the United Kingdom. 
                            In 2018 at the age of 13, his famiy moved to South Africa.
                            He can speak two languages, Shona and English, fluently.

                        <p>
                            Since then he has pushed himself to discover and master different ways of expressing his creative side.
                            Karambakuwa’s work in art attempts to unravel the beauty and mystery of how humans interact with their surroundings.
                            With a recurring theme of unembellished connotation, Karambakuwa explores not-so-random behaviours denoted by human interaction. 
                            Through his love for designing and creating, Karambakuwa documents his work on a dedicated Instagram account, sharing his knowledge and passion with the world.

                            Karambakuwa has devoted his practice to venture into many aspects of programming to unravel a deeper understanding of the art.
                            After intensely studying multiple programming languages he has attained a much greater appreciation of the intricacy that goes into them.
                            Karambakuwa’s areas of focus range from Web, Software and App Developement to Data Science, Machine Learning, Scripting and Algortihms.

                            The necessity of modelling and visualising engineering solutions has propelled Karambakuwa to master Computer Aided Designing.
                            Using CAD, he has integrated the critical role of being a young intrepreneur with the incredible fields of art, programming, engineering and physics through rigorous CAD-enabled analysis of aspirational projects.
